This folder consist of math questions from difference resources 

## Questions

### 1)  Find the largest Prime Factor 
sample : 13195 ==>  5, 7, 13 and 29 and 29 number is the biggest
Find for 600851475143 number 

### 2) Sum square difference
sample : 1 to 10 for each square : 385 
and for sum 1 to 10 and square after we have : 3025

The Difference is 3025 - 385 = 2640 , 

So we want check number one hundred [solution](#number2)

### 3) smallest number divisible by each of the numbers 1 to 20? 

sample : 1 to 10 , we have 2520 ,this number has no remainder

### 4) Find 10001th of prime number 
6th prime number is 13 [solution](#number4)

[solution](#number3)










## Solutions
### <span id="number2"> 2) Sum square difference</span>
If we try to remember some formula , we can solve it 
In the high school we had this formula for sume of number : n * (n+1) /2 
and for square number we have :  n*(n+1)*(2n+1) /6

### <span id="number3">3) smallest number divisible by each of the numbers 1 to 20</span>
For this question , I didn't write any code , just we should try multiple number of 1 to 20 and use prime factorisation for numeber 20 :

2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232,792,560 


### <span id="number4"> 4) Find 10001th of prime number </span>

For solve this problem we can use Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime number and after that 
we can set a long number and store primes in array and return by index 10000
